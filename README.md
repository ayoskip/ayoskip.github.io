# My Awesome Project
This is my first live portfolio site. I learned how to build a static site using Jekyll and host it on Github pages.

**Link to project:** http://ayoskip.github.io/



## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, Jekyll


## Lessons Learned:

Before building this site I had no clue what Jekyll was or how to use it. The best way for me to learn is by doing. I checked out the documentation and started building away. Jekyll is awesome for building static websites using HTML.

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
