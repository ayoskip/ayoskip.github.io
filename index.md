# [](#header-1)I LOVE PIZZA & CODE

Autodidact resilient coder with a huge passion for pizza and {code}. My journey to becoming a developer started late in 2017 when I got a tip about a Hackathon being hosted by a local non-profit that taught underprivileged minority young adults how to code. After completion of the 8 hour hackathon future coders were hand selected for their grit and teamworking skills to  participate in a 14 week intensive full stack coding bootcamp. Resilient Coders introduced me to the world of coding but I didnâ€™t actually begin learning how to code until after bootcamp ended.
