        <p>
          Autodidact coder/programmer living in Columbia, MD.
          My journey to becoming a coder began in the fall of 2017 when I was hand selected to attend a Full Stack Coding Bootcamp hosted by Resilient Coders.
          After completion of bootcamp I continued the learning process by developing my personal portfolio and free lance work for various clients.
          It is my intention to join a experienced development team where I am able to continue  learning and contribute to team projects immediately.
